The last project had us making use of the sensor temperature on the logic board and button interrupts to demonstrate our ability to capture and output temperature data. We were tasked with making use some concepts that were developed of the course of the other term milestones like using our program timers, button interrupts, and the output of data via the UART peripheral. I think my greatest work on this project was my ability to assess the project guidelines and functions provided for the program, I say this as deciphering the workings of code written by another developer especially in a language as verbose as C has always been a challenge for me. I think that the design of the program on the portions I contributed ould be improved y better choice in function break down for the project. It's a constant balancing act on the implementation of OOP concepts

If I am to have a direct hand in writing software that makes of embedded systems, my understanding and knowledge on use cases for UART, GPIO, and memory management are sure to serve me well. The project was made maintainable and adaptable through the use of functions to segment portions of the code that could be reused. Readability was ensured via the use of clear variable naming conventions as well as the adherence to language guidelines on the formatting of C code.
